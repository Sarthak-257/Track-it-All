## 🛰️ Core Features

### 1. Neural Grid (Habit Tracking)
- **Multi-Vector Telemetry**: Track Boolean, Numeric, and Percentage goals.
- **Radial Sync Nodes**: Visualize daily progress with high-tech SVG progress indicators.
- **Streak Repair**: Use `Repair Tokens` to manually re-authorize missed cycles.

### 2. Cognitive Synthesis (Reflections)
- **Epoch Logs**: Free-form journaling with structured prompts ("Positive Vectors" & "Optimization Blockers").
- **Weekly Synthesis**: Automated debriefs summarizing your performance across all active nodes.

### 3. Neural Distinctions (Gamification)
- **Achievement Vault**: Earn high-rarity badges for protocol adherence.
- **Social Quests**: Compete in global challenges to accelerate your ranking.

### 4. Interface Paradigms (Theming)
- **Dark Protocol**: The default deep-space UI for nightly operations.
- **Light Protocol**: High-contrast, hyper-clean "lab" aesthetic.
- **Focus Mode**: Minimalist, distraction-free monochrome interface.
- **Minimal Mode**: Transparent, borderless "ghost" UI.

## 🛠️ Deploying the Net

### 1. Server Initialization (Express/MongoDB)
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
**Required Environment Telemetry (.env):**
- `MONGODB_URI`: Secure connection string.
- `JWT_SECRET`: Authorization encryption key.
- `EMAIL_USER`: Primary uplink for OTP relay.
- `EMAIL_PASS`: Encrypted credential for mail server.

### 2. Client Activation (Next.js/Framer)
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
**Required Environment Telemetry (.env.local):**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: Backend endpoint coordinate.
